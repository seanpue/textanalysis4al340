To each freshman girl may I say especially; welcome to Michigan State College. This campus will not seem such a tangle of paths and strange people after the first few weeks. Do not fail to come in often to this office, which is maintained chiefly to meet your needs and help make your college years successful. There are so many of you this year that you must look me up, because I cannot you unless you make it possible for me to do so. Miss Petersen and I, in this office, may be able to suggest ways to find the answers to your perplexing questions. Won't you come in early and see us? Some of you new students this fall are transferring from other colleges with vanced standing. Our upperclass students are friendly and will be helpful with social suggestions, but because they are not always informed on the latest college riculum requirements, it is safer in such cases to consult your advisor or some one in my office promptly, even for casual formation. You as Sophomores and Juniors must start at once to find friends, adopt our ways, and learn to meet the requirements for success in order to become contributing . members in this college which you have. chosen and which we want you to help us build. Cordially, ELISABETH CONRAD, Dean of Women. 7  NANCY B. FARLEY President, A. W. S. 8  Welcome, new women students, to the Michigan State College campus! In behalf of the Associated Women dents, may I wish you a happy ment to your new surroundings. This justment is a challenge to you.

Your A. W. S. handbook is a guide to a rapid assimilation of our requirements. Use it! If at any time it is not clear, we are always at hand to interpret it for you. Accept this challenge offered you! Make your years at Michigan State well rounded ones, full of new experiences, lasting friendships, interesting activities, together with the actual enjoyment of the course of study you have chosen.
